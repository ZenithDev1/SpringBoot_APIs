## PROJECT ::- schoolManagement

## PROJECT STACK: Java, Spring Boot, SQL, Git, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, and Java Collections.
FUTURE UPGRADES IN THIS PROJECT
This schoolManagement project is halfway through and already evolving beyond a simple CRUD app! I’m adding Spring Data JPA, microservices, a fee payment module, and Razorpay integration for seamless transactions. Next up: Docker and Kafka to make it scalable, and production-ready—on track to becoming an enterprise-grade system

## PROJECT STATUS AT THIS MOMENT
I’ve mastered building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot—covering CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete{with PUT ans PATCH }), request validation, and error handling. This phase gave me solid hands-on experience in designing, developing, and testing robust APIs.
